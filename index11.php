                        <p>Workplace discrimination occurs when an employee or job applicant is treated unfavorably
                            because of protected characteristics, which typically include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Race, color, and national origin</li>
                            <li>Gender and gender identity</li>

                            <li>Religion</li>
                            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Discrimination can take many forms, including hiring/firing decisions, pay disparities,
                            harassment, and denial of benefits or promotions. Employers are legally prohibited from
                            discriminating against employees based on these characteristics.</p>
